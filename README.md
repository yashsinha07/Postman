#Postman Collection Automator

This project bascially takes two files.
1. Exported Postman Collection file.
2. Data file for the collection.

We make use of the newman library to hit the APIs in the collection through the terminal. We are also storing the results of hit as PASS or FAIL in a new .csv file.
